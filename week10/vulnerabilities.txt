1./admin/***
Endpoints where you can make changes to the database must be available only for admins!
Fix: make it accessible only for users with "ADMIN" role.
2./order/{id}
If we suppose that ordering system in future will have payment and delivery system, it is necessary
to secure this endpoint to make sure that non-registered can not access it.
Fix: make it accessible only for authenticated users.
