Endpoints I needed to test:
1./main
2./showDrink/{id}
3./addDrink
4./updateDrink/{id}
5./order/{id}
6./deleteDrink/{id}

1) For the first endpoint I requested with <http://localhost:8080/main> on Postman
and its response body was:
(
	0-Coca-Cola 500 ml-75
	1-Coca-Cola 1000 ml-105
	2-Coca-Cola 2000 ml-190
	3-Pepsi 500 ml-80
	4-Pepsi 1000 ml-130
	5-Mineral Water 1000ml-60
), the drinks from the table("drinks") into which I inserted records before the test.

2) For the second endpoint I requested with <http://localhost:8080/showDrink/1> and it responded with
JSON file of drink entity with id of 1:
	{
 	   "id": 1,
  	   "name": "Coca-Cola 1000 ml",
   	   "price_in_soms": 105
	}.

3) For the third mt request was following:
URL: http://localhost:8080/addDrink
Body:
{
    "name": "Lemonade 1000 ml",
    "price_in_soms": 120
}

The response was was: "New drink was successfully added to the database!". And the new drink was indeed inserted to the database)

4) For the fourth:
URL: http://localhost:8080/updateDrink/6 (*The id of the new added drink was 6)
Body:
{
    "name": "Lemonade 1000 ml",
    "price_in_soms": 111
}
Response was: "Drink was successfully updated!"

5) For the fifth:
URL: http://localhost:8080/orderDrink/3
Body: None
Response was: "Drink Pepsi 500 ml was succesfully delivered to your berloga! Enjoy!"

6) The last one:
URL: http://localhost:8080/deleteDrink/6
Response was: Drink was successfully deleted from the database!

And that's how I tested my freshly-written online shop api. Thank you for reading!
