***These instructions are written assuming that you already have downloaded the latest version of the project
1.Start your docker engine
2.Make sure that in [/drinkshop/target] directory there is a file named drinkshop-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
3.Open any terminal (I used Powershell)
4.Set current directory to the project's main file [***/drinkshop] 
5.Enter the command: [docker-compose up]   (without brackets obviously)
Wualya, the app is now accessible on [localhost:8888/]
